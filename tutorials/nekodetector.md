# How to download and execute [Nekodetector](https://github.com/MCRcortex/nekodetector "MCRcortex's Nekodetector")

1. Download the latest Nekodetector from the Releases Page: [RELEASES](https://github.com/MCRcortex/nekodetector/releases "Releases")
2. Locate the downloaded .jar file
3. Open a terminal (linux) or cmd (windows) and navigate to the downloaded file via `cd`
4. Execution:
For Windows, execute `java -jar <name_of_downloaded_jar_file>.jar 4 C:\` to scan your full pc (C:\ drive) using 4 threads (depending on you specs, you can use more to increase the scan-speed).
On Linux, do `java -jar <name_of_downloaded_jar_file>.jar 4 /` todo the same, 4 is again the number of threads to use.
5. If  the scanner doesn't detect any malware, you should try out a fewother scanners, but in most cases you are **not** infected. Stay safe!
If the scanner detects errors with "___MACOS" in them, you don't  have to worry either (to my knowledge).
If you are infected, please refer to this article: [I'm infected - Now what?](https://github.com/fractureiser-investigation/fractureiser/blob/main/docs/users.md#im-infected-now-what "I'm infected, now what? - Fractureiser-Investiogation")
